Rusber New Run Level Control Subsystem : 

Unlike standard Run level control subsystem on must of Linux distribution , rusber RLCS ( Run Level Control Subsystem ) is much different , for long i believe that /etc/rc.[123456].d and creating Symbolic links start with S or K is kind of not easily Administrative without Other Application to configure it ( like sysvconfig ) simply getting some system under Debian its kind of faulty to disable some service on bootstrapping and its easily possible to make mistakes which are not harmful most of the times but time consuming . 

the idea is that to have Plain text file under /etc , named rlcs.conf , file format is look like :

/etc/rlcs.conf 
# rlcs.conf 

#rc1 Single user or "still Bootstrapping" .
#rc2 Bootstrapping is done , ready to work .
#rc3 halt/reboot

rc1 { 
...
killproc
halt
...
}

rc2 {
...
klogd
syslogd
...
}

rc3 { 
...
sshd
crond
atd
...
}

executable server starter shell scripts stored under /etc/init.d/ , init will run /etc/init.d/rlcs ( which is some bash or perl script ) that grep rc1 { } services and starts them by Listing Priority (Priority of killproc is more than halt in rc1 , example above ) .



Simple and beautiful , isn't it ? its not tested , but i hope it works , much easier to administrative.
